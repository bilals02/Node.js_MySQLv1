# Bamazon Project

**Objective:**
To create an amazon prototype of an ordering system which checks the inventory and allows user to purchase based on stock. If there is not enough to cover the order, prompt the user that there is not enough inventory, otherwise process the order.


**Getting Started:** 
* Clone Repo
* Run command in Terminal or Gitbash 'npm install
* Run 'ctrl + c' to exit each mode


**What does BamazonCustomer.js JavaScript do?**
* Prints the products in the store.
* Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase by ID number.
* Asks for the quantity.
* If there is a sufficient amount of the product in stock, it will return the total for that purchase.
However, if there is not enough of the product in stock, it will tell the user that there isn't enough of the product.
* If the purchase goes through, it updates the stock quantity to reflect the purchase.
